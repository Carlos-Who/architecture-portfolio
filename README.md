# ArchitecturePortfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.

---
## Description
This is a web portfolio designed for people who work in the field of architecture. It can be used as a personal multipurpose web portfolio, however the minimalistic design and color palette was inspired by similar architecture websites, thatÂ´s why this portfolio fits perfectly on this field. 


##  Styling
This project was made following the **mobile-first** design strategy. And as mentioned above, it can be used for multiple purposes, so if it is necessary to change the colors of the main design, simply go to ``scss > themes > dark-theme.scss``

**NOTE:** The ``dark-theme.scss`` file does not contain all the styling options of the project, there are some styles that remains on their respective components. However, most of the styles are set on this file like: (main colors, fonts, etc..)
